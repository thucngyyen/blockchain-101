# Concensus Protocol: Proof of Work (PoW)

## Competing chain:
- If some computers try to add malicous transactions into the new block, they have to compete with rest of the network.
- Then, they will try to calculate the next block, the longer chain (faster block) will be the "correct" chain. Which will replace all the malicous blocks. Therefore, in order to take over a PoW blockchain, the malicous computers have to be over 51% of the total hash power of the network.
- This is how PoW solve this problem.
